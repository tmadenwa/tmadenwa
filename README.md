BIO: My name is Thomas Madenwald and I'm currently a student at ASU studying Graphic Information Technology. The goal is to get my BS in GIT with a focus in video and photography and pursue a career that's related to that. In my free time I've been producing a short film that will premiere this year in Texas. My hobbies are playing guitar and writing but once a week you'll find me at In-N-Out wrecking a double-double.
